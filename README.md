3) `npm run dev --prefix client/`

# State of Delivery
In general the I am very unsatisfied with the state of delivery.
I came up with a very rocky start, from my difficulties with understand minimum specifications,
which led me to spend the first two weeks overworking myself with features that didn't contribute to the requirement.
After which I spent the last week rushing to just get it working in as basic a state as possible.
I had to cut a lot of corners in order to make it in time for the project deadline, so the code is very unoptimal and
way below my normal standards (particularly the client application).

However, I am satisfied that I made it in time, and I've had a lot of learning opportunities
for how to do things differently in future projects, as to not make the same mistakes again.
